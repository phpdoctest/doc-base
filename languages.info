The languages.list is used in place of old svn:externals solution to allow
tools discover all the languages (including en) of the PHP Manual. It means
that it is crucial to add every new translation there. For the record, empty
lines are ignored, as well as anything starting with "#" is treated as a
comment.

Sample PHP implementation:

function get_langugages() {
	return array_filter(file('/path/to/languages.list', FILE_IGNORE_NEW_LINES), function ($line) {
		return $line !== '' && $line[0] !== '#';
	});
}
